## About the Project
Sitemaps are fantastic resources, but manually combing through them is tedious. I wanted a quick way to find specific content patterns within a website's structure. Tracebound does just that. It leverages the sitemap to crawl all linked pages efficiently,  hunting for any phrase or keyword I specify. It's been a fun little experiment in focused web crawling!
